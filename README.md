The timeline application for the Meadows area in Nottingham aimed to assist the community better capture the history of the area. The tool will act a support tool to crowd-source community information to help recreate the history of the Meadows community.


Principal Elements

It is envisioned that capturing this information will allow the development of the community to be uncovered and shared with all. Users add information about an event in the Meadows, add entry, select a location from the map on the screen, click on the location you are interested in to add an entry. Users can enter the title of the event in the first entry box, enter a brief description of the event, key dates, categories, and upload files relating to the event.

The purpose of the web application is to crowd source information for the local residents. It was built using various JavaScript libraries (like OpenLayers, Timeline.JS) as well as PHP.
1. Tutorial
The application includes a video tutorial on user interaction with the application.
2. Adding and entry
Users are encouraged to add their local knowledge of an area, a site, or a building to the application. They can share documents, imagery or video that better explains the history of a site. User can add a space by clicking the 'add entry' tab and filling out information in the resulting modal which includes a map to pinpoint a location.
3. Interacting with the timeline
Users of application can navigate via the map or the timeline. The map interface showing a geographic map view of the location of those sites can be useful to users who wish to drill down to an area of particular interest. Similarly, other users may wish to experience that through the chronology of events as they occurred and in which century.
